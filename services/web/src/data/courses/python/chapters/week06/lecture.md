# Loops

Loops are fundamental in Python for performing repetitive tasks. Python's for loop iterates over sequences (like lists, strings, or ranges) in a clean and readable way. In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore several common looping techniques and dive into some advanced topics such as controlling ranges, sorting selections, nested loops, breaking out of nested loops, and common loop patterns.

<summary>Loops Overview</summary>

- range: Iterate over a sequence of numbers with full control over start, stop, and step.
- list: Iterate directly over each element in a list.
enumerate with index: Get both the index and the element simultaneously.
sorted: Sort a list and iterate over its elements.
sorted and subset: Sort a list (e.g., of grades) and select a subset (e.g., the three lowest grades).
- Nested loops: Loop inside another loop.
- Breaking nested loops: Techniques to exit multiple loops elegantly.
- Loop Patterns: Common patterns such as accumulators, filtering, flags, and more.

## 1. For in range

The range() function generates a sequence of numbers. It can be controlled using:

- Start and Stop: range(start, stop) starts at start and stops at stop - 1.
- Step: range(start, stop, step) allows you to jump by a given amount.

### Examples:

Default Range (0 to n-1):

``` python
for i in range(5):  # Generates numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    print("Iteration:", i)
```

Custom Start and Stop:

``` python
for i in range(2, 7):  # Generates numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    print("Iteration:", i)
```

Jumping by Steps:

``` python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Generates numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
    print("Jumping 2 by 2:", i)
```

Counting Backwards:

``` python
for i in range(10, 0, -2):  # Generates numbers 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
    print("Counting backwards by 2:", i)
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to print numbers from 10 to 2 in reverse order jumping by 2.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def print_reverse():\n   # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint_reverse()",
"expectedOutput": "10\n8\n6\n4\n2"
}
!!!

## 2. For in list

Iterate directly over each element in a list:

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

- Each loop iteration gives you the next element in the list.
- This method is simple and very readable.

## 3. For in enumerate with index

When you need both the element and its index, `enumerate()` is very handy:

``` python
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
```

- `enumerate(iterable)` returns tuples of `(index, element)`.
- You can also specify a different starting index: `enumerate(iterable, start=1)`.

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to print the index and value of each element in a list in the format 'Index {index}: {value}'.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def print_index_and_value(cities):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint_index_and_value(['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago'])",
"expectedOutput": "Index 0: New York\nIndex 1: Los Angeles\nIndex 2: Chicago"
}
!!!

## 4. For in sorted with ranges

You can use `sorted()` to sort a list and then select a subset. For example, suppose you have a list of grades and want to print the three lowest grades:

``` python
grades = [88, 92, 79, 85, 95, 70]
for grade in sorted(grades)[:3]: # slice the first 3 elements
    print(grade)
```

- `sorted()` returns a new sorted list without modifying the original.
- Slicing (`sorted_grades[:3]`) lets you select only the first three elements, which are the lowest in this case.

## 5. Loop Patterns

Beyond the basic loop constructs, several common patterns help you solve recurring problems more elegantly. These include accumulators, filtering, flags, and more.

### 5.1 Accumulator Pattern

The accumulator pattern is used to combine or sum up values from a loop. This pattern is useful for aggregating data, such as summing numbers or concatenating strings.

``` python
# Example: Summing a List of Numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total += num
print("Total Sum:", total)  # Output: Total Sum: 15
```

``` python
words = ["Hello", "world", "from", "Python"]
sentence = ""  # Accumulator string
for word in words:
    sentence += word + " "
print(sentence.strip())
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to calculate the product of all numbers in a list.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def product_of_list(numbers):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint(product_of_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))",
"expectedOutput": "24"
}
!!!

### 5.2 Filtering Pattern

The filtering pattern involves iterating over a sequence and selecting only those elements that meet a specified condition. Often, you store the filtered elements in a new list.

``` python
# Example: Filtering Even Numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
evens = []  # Container for even numbers
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(number)
print("Even numbers:", evens)
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to filter all leap years from a list of years.",
"language": "python",
"code": "#A year is a leap year if it's evenly divisible by 4. For example, 2024 and 2028 are leap years.\nA year that's divisible by 100, but not by 400, is not a leap year. For example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years.\nA year that's divisible by 400 is a leap year. For example, 2000 and 2400 are leap years.\n\ndef filter_leap_years(years):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint(filter_leap_years([1700,1800,1900,2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008]))",
"expectedOutput": "[2000, 2004, 2008]"
}
!!!

### 5.3 Search or Flag Pattern

The flag pattern uses a boolean variable (flag) to signal when a condition has been met during iteration. This is especially useful for terminating loops early when a desired condition occurs.

``` python
# Example: Finding a Specific Element
items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
found_flag = False  # Flag indicating if the element is found

for item in items:
    if item == "cherry":
        found_flag = True
        break
if found_flag:
    print("Cherry was found!")
else:
    print("Cherry was not found.")
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to check if a list contains negative numbers.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def contains_negative(numbers):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint(contains_negative([1, 2, -3, 4]))",
"expectedOutput": "True"
}
!!!

### 5.4 Counting Pattern

Count how many times a particular condition is met.

``` python
colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green", "blue", "red"]
count_red = 0
for color in colors:
    if color == "red":
        count_red += 1
print("Number of reds:", count_red)  # Output: Number of reds: 3
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to count the number of vowels in a string.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def count_vowels(s):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint(count_vowels('Hello World'))",
"expectedOutput": "3"
}
!!!

### 5.5 Building a Collection with transformation

Transform each element during iteration and add it to a new list.

``` python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = []
for number in numbers:
    squared.append(number ** 2)
print("Squared numbers:", squared)  # Output: Squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### 5.6 Early Exit

Stop processing as soon as a condition is met by encapsulating your loop in a function.

``` python
def find_first_negative(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        if number < 0:
            return number  # Immediately exits the function
    return None

nums = [1, 2, 3, -4, 5]
first_negative = find_first_negative(nums)
print("First negative number:", first_negative)
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to find the first float number in a list.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def find_first_float(numbers):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint(find_first_float([1, 2, 3.5, 4, 5]))",
"expectedOutput": "3.5"
}
!!!

### 5.7 Find the max or min value

Find the maximum or minimum value in a list.

``` python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
max_value = numbers[0]
for number in numbers:
    if number > max_value:
        max_value = number
print("Maximum value:", max_value)  # Output: Maximum value: 9
```

!!! code
{
"description": "Implement a function to find the minimum value in a list.",
"language": "python",
"code": "def find_min(numbers):\n    # your code goes here\n\n# do not modify the code below\nprint(find_min([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]))",
"expectedOutput": "1"
}
