- Focus your feedback on:
    - The **scope** of the project and how much has been completed.
    - What has changed and improved since the beginning.
    - If a testable build is available, **playtest it** and provide insights on functionality, clarity, and user experience.

### **Deadline**
- Ensure you submit your project and complete your peer reviews by the assigned deadline.
