# Assignment: Create Your Demo Reel Content

## Objectives

- **Develop a Detailed Storyboard/Script:** Outline the structure of your demo reel, including the introduction, key
  highlight segments, and conclusion.
- **Capture High-Quality Footage:** Record and collect initial clips that demonstrate various aspects of your technical
  work.

::: warning "Important"

You must deliver a 30s demo reel about your work and yourself for the Champlain Senior show. This is a requirement, but you can deliver more in-depth videos to be showcased on the Game Studio showcase website as extra material. So focus on making a 30s demo reel for the Senior show first, and if you have time, make a longer one for the website.

## Part 1: Storyboard/Script for Your Demo Reel

### Task

Create a comprehensive storyboard or script that details the structure of your demo reel. Your document should clearly
outline:

- **Introduction:**  
  Describe how you will open your demo reel to grab the audience’s attention and introduce yourself.

- **Key Highlight Segments:**  
  Identify and detail the main features or projects you plan to showcase. Include notes on transitions, visual effects,
  and any accompanying text or audio commentary that will enhance these segments.

- **Conclusion/Outro:**  
  Explain how you will wrap up your demo reel. Include any calls-to-action (e.g., links to your portfolio or contact
  information) and summarize the key messages.

### Guidelines

- **Storyboard Template:**  
  You are required to use the storyboard template available
  at [Miro Storyboard Templates](https://miro.com/templates/storyboard/). This will help you organize your ideas
  visually and ensure a coherent narrative flow.
- Clearly indicate which visuals or clips you plan to capture.
- Include any ideas for text overlays, background music, or narration.
- Organize your storyboard/script in a logical sequence to ensure a smooth and engaging narrative.

effectively demonstrate various aspects of your technical work, such as:

  Capture dynamic gameplay footage that highlights the core mechanics of your game.

- **Technical Demonstrations:**  
  Record segments that showcase your debugging tools, AI behavior, or other technical features.

- **Diverse Visuals:**  
  Include clips that show a variety of angles and scenarios, ensuring a well-rounded view of your work.

### Guidelines

- Ensure that the clips are clear and representative of your best work.
