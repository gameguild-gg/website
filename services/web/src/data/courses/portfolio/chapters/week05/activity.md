# In-Class Activity: Evaluating Previous Champlain Game Programming Demo Reels

## Objective

In this activity, you will research and evaluate previous Champlain game programming demo reels. The goal is to analyze
successful examples, understand best practices, identify areas for improvement, and apply these insights to your own
demo reel projects.

## Activity Instructions

### Step 1: Research Previous Demo Reels

1. **Locate Demo Reels:**
    - Visit the Champlain's Gallery website  https://seniorshow.champlain.edu/gallery/
    - Aim to review at least two different demo reels to get a variety of examples.

2. **Watch the Demo Reels:**
    - As you watch each demo reel, take detailed notes on the following elements:
        - How the reel introduces the programmer and captures the audience’s attention
        - The clarity and effectiveness in showcasing technical skills
        - The visual quality (graphics, animations, effects)
        - Audio quality (sound effects, music, voice acting)
        - The narrative structure and flow (intro, highlights, outro)
        - The presence and effectiveness of a call-to-action

### Step 2: Evaluate the Demo Reels

Using the evaluation criteria below, assess each demo reel. Record your responses and any additional observations.

#### Evaluation Worksheet

Create a google spreadsheet with the following columns:

- **Captivating Intro:**
    - Does the demo reel start with an engaging introduction?
    - How effectively does it hook the viewer right away?

- **Showcasing Technical Skills:**
    - How well does the reel demonstrate technical abilities (e.g., game mechanics, debugging tools, AI behavior)?
    - Which aspects of the technical work are most effectively highlighted?

- **Visuals and Audio Quality:**
    - Evaluate the overall quality of visuals, including graphics, animations, and special effects.
    - Assess the clarity and integration of audio elements like music, sound effects, and voice acting.

- **Narrative and Flow:**
    - Is there a clear and logical structure (intro, highlights, outro) in the demo reel?
    - How well does the sequence of clips maintain viewer engagement?

- **Call-to-Action:**
    - Does the demo reel end with a clear call-to-action (e.g., links to a portfolio, contact details)?
    - How persuasive is the call-to-action?

### Step 3: Group Discussion

1. **Form Small Groups:**
    - Divide into groups of 2-3 students.

2. **Share Your Findings:**
    - Discuss your evaluations and compare notes on each demo reel.
    - Identify common strengths and weaknesses, and share any unique approaches you observed.

3. **Highlight Key Takeaways:**
    - As a group, agree on at least two key insights or best practices that you believe are crucial for creating an
      effective demo reel.
    - Appoint a spokesperson to summarize your group’s findings for the class.

4. **Class Discussion:**
    - Each group will present their key takeaways.
    - Engage in a whole-class discussion to explore how these insights can be applied to your own demo reel projects.

## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating the demo reels and during your discussions, consider the following:

- **Clarity of Presentation:**
    - Does the reel clearly communicate the programmer's skills and projects?

- **Engagement:**
    - Is the demo reel engaging and capable of holding the viewer’s attention throughout?

- **Technical Depth:**
    - How effectively does the reel demonstrate technical skills and problem-solving abilities?

- **Visual and Audio Integration:**
    - Are the visuals and audio elements used in a way that enhances the overall impact of the reel?

- **Structure and Flow:**
    - Is there a coherent narrative structure from beginning to end?
