::: tip "Key Takeaways"

When applying for a job, one size never fits all. A generic cover letter or resume won’t capture the attention of hiring managers who are looking for specific qualifications.

::: 

## Why a Cover Letter Matters

Your cover letter is your opportunity to make a strong first impression. While a resume lists your skills and experiences, a cover letter tells your story. It allows you to:

- Show your enthusiasm for the role and company.
- Highlight how your experiences align with the position.
- Provide context for your work that a resume alone cannot convey.
- Demonstrate your communication skills.

::: tip "Cover Letter Tip"

A great cover letter makes hiring managers want to meet you. Be bold, humble, and authentic in your writing.

## Tailoring Your Cover Letter to Match the Job

A generic cover letter will not get you hired. You need to customize each letter to the job you’re applying for.

### Key Strategies:

- **Research the Position:**
    - Carefully review the job description.
    - Identify the key skills and experiences required.
    - Visit the company’s website and check their past games, mission statement, and culture.
    - If possible, play their games or watch gameplay footage.
    - Customize your cover letter and resume to address those specific points.

- **Use Keywords:**
    - Incorporate keywords from the job posting into your resume and cover letter.
    - This not only shows you’re a good match but also helps your application get past automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

- **Tailor Your Narrative:**
    - Your cover letter should explain why you’re a perfect fit for the position.
    - Use specific examples from your past projects and experiences that align with the job requirements.
    - Identify the top skills and experiences they are looking for.
    - Provide specific examples from your past work that align with these requirements.

## Structuring an Effective Cover Letter

A well-structured cover letter is easy to read and conveys your message clearly. Here’s a typical structure for a cover letter:

### 1. Opening Paragraph: Hook & Introduction

- State the position you're applying for and express enthusiasm.
- Mention why you’re excited about the opportunity.
- Personalize it. If their games have influenced you, say so!

::: example "Opening Paragraph Example"

As a long-time fan of **Company Name** and someone deeply inspired by your games, I was thrilled to see the opening for a **Job Title** and potentially work with the legendary team behind **Game Title**. I am excited to bring my passion for game development and my technical skills to your team.

:::

### 2. Body Paragraphs: Your Value & Experiences

- Highlight specific projects that showcase your skills. Focus on the ones you think are most relevant to the job.
- Emphasize how your experience matches their needs.
- Use numbers and concrete results when possible. Use the argument-evidence-impact structure.

::: example "Body Paragraph Example"

In my previous role at **Company** / **Capstone team**, I developed an AI pathfinding system that improved enemy behavior, reducing CPU load by `30%` while enhancing player immersion. I believe these skills would directly benefit your team’s ongoing work on **Project or Game**.

:::

In the body paragraphs, you can also include:

- **Technical Skills:**
    - List programming languages, tools, and frameworks you are proficient in.
    - Highlight skills that are directly relevant to game programming, such as game engines, debugging tools, and performance optimization techniques.

- **Projects:**
    - Showcase your portfolio projects that demonstrate your coding abilities.
    - Briefly describe the project scope, your role, and the technologies used.
    - Include links to your GitHub repositories or demo reels where possible.

- **Achievements:**
    - Emphasize awards, recognitions, or successful outcomes from past projects.
    - Quantify your achievements with metrics (e.g., “Optimized game performance, reducing load times by 30%”).

### 3. Closing Paragraph: Call to Action & Gratitude

- Reaffirm your enthusiasm for the role.
- Express interest in discussing the opportunity further.
- Thank them for their time.

::: example "Closing Paragraph Example"

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to **Company Name** and would love to discuss how my skills align with your team’s needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.

## Using the Right Tone for the Game Industry

Unlike corporate environments where cover letters tend to be formal and rigid, the game industry allows for a more relaxed and passionate tone. However, balance is key—you still need to remain professional.

- Be Passionate: Show excitement about their games and the opportunity.
- Be Personal: Mention specific games, mechanics, or design choices that resonate with you.
- Be Conversational, But Professional: You can inject personality but avoid being too casual.

::: example "Tone Example"

Growing up, **Game Title** was one of the first games that made me truly appreciate the art of game development. The way **specific mechanic** shaped the player’s experience was a huge inspiration for me. Now, as a game programmer with experience in **skill**, I’m excited about the chance to contribute to **Company Name**.
