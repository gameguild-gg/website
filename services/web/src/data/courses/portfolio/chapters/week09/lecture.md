## **Editing for Pacing, Transitions, and Clarity**

A great demo reel is **not just about content** but also how you **present it dynamically**.

### **Pacing**
- **Keep it snappy**—most viewers lose interest after a few seconds.
- Follow a **crescendo structure**—start with a strong highlight, maintain energy, and end on an impactful note.
- **Fast cuts for action, slower cuts for detail.**

### **Transitions**
- **Cut on motion** to make edits feel seamless.
- Use **crossfades and wipes sparingly**—hard cuts often work best.
- Match transitions to the **tempo of the background music**.

### **Clarity**
- **Avoid excessive effects**—keep the focus on the content.
- Use **subtle text overlays** to describe what’s being shown.
- Ensure **readable fonts** (avoid small, cursive, or highly stylized text).

---

## **Adding Music & Voiceovers**

### **Music Selection**
- Use royalty-free or self-composed music.
- Match the **tone** to your project (e.g., upbeat for arcade games, atmospheric for horror).
- Keep **background music subtle**—avoid overpowering your visuals.

### **Voiceover Tips**
- Keep narration **short and to the point**.
- Maintain **consistent volume levels**—avoid sudden spikes.
- Speak **clearly and confidently**—practice your script before recording.

## **The 3 Levels of Emotional Processing in a 30-Second Reel**

Inspired by [Donald A. Norman’s Emotional Design Model](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/norman-s-three-levels-of-design), your demo reel should engage at least one of these levels:

1. **Visceral Level (Instant Reaction)**
    - Make an **impact in the first 3 seconds of content** with an exciting moment or striking visual.
    - Ensure high-quality visuals and smooth animations.

2. **Behavioral Level (Practical Understanding)**
    - Show off **game mechanics, level design, or AI behavior** in a way that’s easy to grasp.
    - Use **before-and-after comparisons** or split-screen effects to highlight progress.

3. **Reflective Level (Deeper Meaning)**
    - End with a **memorable moment**—a great mechanic, a unique style, or a creative innovation.
    - Use a **tagline or logo** to reinforce your personal brand.
