### **Key Principles for a 30-Second Reel**

1. **Balance & Composition**
    - Use **rule of thirds** and framing techniques to guide the viewer’s focus.
    - Avoid clutter—ensure clarity by highlighting essential elements.

2. **Contrast & Hierarchy**
    - Emphasize the most impressive features of your work.
    - Use **bold, bright, or animated transitions** to direct attention.

3. **Repetition & Rhythm**
    - Keep a **consistent visual language** throughout (e.g., same fonts, text styles, and colors).
    - Use rhythmic cuts and transitions to **maintain flow and engagement**.

4. **Alignment & Proportion**
    - Keep UI elements and overlays **aligned and readable**.
    - Ensure elements are **sized appropriately** to avoid overwhelming visuals.

## **Editing for Pacing, Transitions, and Clarity**

A great demo reel is **not just about content** but also how you **present it dynamically**.

### **Pacing**
- **Keep it snappy**—most viewers lose interest after a few seconds.
- Follow a **crescendo structure**—start with a strong highlight, maintain energy, and end on an impactful note.
- **Fast cuts for action, slower cuts for detail.**

### **Transitions**
- **Cut on motion** to make edits feel seamless.
- Use **crossfades and wipes sparingly**—hard cuts often work best.
- Match transitions to the **tempo of the background music**.

### **Clarity**
- **Avoid excessive effects**—keep the focus on the content.
- Use **subtle text overlays** to describe what’s being shown.
- Ensure **readable fonts** (avoid small, cursive, or highly stylized text).

---

## **Adding Music & Voiceovers**

### **Music Selection**
- Use royalty-free or self-composed music.
- Match the **tone** to your project (e.g., upbeat for arcade games, atmospheric for horror).
- Keep **background music subtle**—avoid overpowering your visuals.

### **Voiceover Tips**
- Keep narration **short and to the point**.
- Maintain **consistent volume levels**—avoid sudden spikes.
- Speak **clearly and confidently**—practice your script before recording.

## **The 3 Levels of Emotional Processing in a 30-Second Reel**

Inspired by [Donald A. Norman’s Emotional Design Model](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/norman-s-three-levels-of-design), your demo reel should engage at least one of these levels:

1. **Visceral Level (Instant Reaction)**
    - Make an **impact in the first 3 seconds of content** with an exciting moment or striking visual.
    - Ensure high-quality visuals and smooth animations.

2. **Behavioral Level (Practical Understanding)**
    - Show off **game mechanics, level design, or AI behavior** in a way that’s easy to grasp.
    - Use **before-and-after comparisons** or split-screen effects to highlight progress.

3. **Reflective Level (Deeper Meaning)**
    - End with a **memorable moment**—a great mechanic, a unique style, or a creative innovation.
    - Use a **tagline or logo** to reinforce your personal brand.

## **Tools for Editing & Enhancing Your Reel**

- [Color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - for color theory and palette selection.
- [Contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - to ensure text is readable against backgrounds.
- [Color blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) - to check how your reel appears to colorblind viewers.

## **Detecting and Preventing Issues Before They Happen**

A polished demo reel isn't just about fixing mistakes after they occur, it is about anticipating problems before they disrupt your presentation. Here are strategies to **detect and prevent issues early** in your editing process.

---

### **1. Use a Storyboard or Timeline Outline**
Before diving into editing, **plan out the flow** of your demo reel. A rough **storyboard or text-based timeline** helps ensure:

- ✅ A strong **opening hook** and impactful ending.  
- ✅ **Balanced pacing**—not too rushed or too slow.  
- ✅ Logical **progression of shots** to maintain clarity.

::: tip

Sketch out key moments or list timestamps with descriptions (e.g., *“00:03 - Character animation showcase”*).

:::

---

### **2. Check for Visual Clarity Early**

- 👀 **Watch your reel without sound** to test if visuals alone communicate your message.  
- 🎭 **Desaturate (black & white mode)** to check if contrast is strong enough.  
- 📏 **Pause at random frames**—each shot should be **visually readable** without excessive clutter.
- 🔍 **Focus in on text** to ensure it’s legible at different sizes, add overlays, and backgrounds behind the texts to improve readability.
- 🖌️ **Use color theory** to ensure your color palette is visually appealing and accessible, and test for color blindness.

---

### **3. Listen for Audio Issues**

- 🔊 **Play your reel at different volumes** to ensure no sound is overpowering.  
- 🎙️ **Check voiceovers** for clarity and balance—avoid music drowning out narration.  
- 🎵 **Test with and without sound** to ensure key moments aren’t entirely dependent on audio.

::: tip

If using music, ensure smooth fades and avoid abrupt cuts.

### **4. Simulate Different Viewing Experiences**

Not everyone will watch your reel on the same screen. Test your reel in different scenarios:

- 📱 **Phone screen test** – Are small text and UI elements still readable?  
- 💻 **Different resolutions** – Does your footage lose quality when resized?  
- 🌞 **Brightness test** – Watch it in a bright environment to check visibility.

---

### **5. Ask for Targeted Feedback Before Finalizing**

🚀 **Before showing your reel, ask reviewers to focus on specific concerns**:

- *Does the pacing feel too fast or slow?*
- *Is any section confusing or unclear?*
- *Are transitions smooth or distracting?*
- *Does the color contrast make key elements stand out?*

::: tip

Include a short text with your submission asking peers to **focus on one or two areas** you’re unsure about.
